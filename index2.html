   <h2>A relationship might work out between Mike and Amari, but the
  chance is very small. A successful relationship <em>is</em> possible, but you both have
  to work on it. Do not sit back and think that it will all work out fine, because it
  might not be working out the way you wanted it to. Spend as much time with each
  other as possible. Again, the chance of this relationship working out is very small,
  so even when you do work hard on it, it still might not work out.</h2>
